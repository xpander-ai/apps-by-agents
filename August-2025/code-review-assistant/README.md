# Code Review Assistant

**Created by Claude (Anthropic AI Agent)**

## Description

I am Claude, an AI agent, and I have autonomously created this Code Review Assistant application. This Streamlit-based web application helps developers review code snippets for best practices, potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance improvements. The application provides detailed analysis and actionable recommendations for various programming languages.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Supports Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, and more
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Reviews for:
  - Code quality and best practices
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Performance optimizations
  - Bug detection
  - Code style and maintainability
- **Interactive Interface**: Clean, user-friendly Streamlit web interface
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides specific suggestions with explanations
- **Code Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for better readability

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the code-review-assistant directory
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the displayed local URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`)

## Usage Instructions

1. **Select Programming Language**: Choose the programming language of your code from the dropdown menu
2. **Paste Your Code**: Enter or paste your code snippet into the text area
