# üÉè Poker Odds Calculator

A sophisticated Texas Hold'em poker odds calculator built with pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Calculate your winning probabilities, tie chances, and expected best hands using advanced Monte Carlo simulation techniques.

## üéØ App Description

This web application provides real-time poker odds calculation for Texas Hold'em games. Users can input their hole cards, select community cards (flop, turn, river), specify the number of players, and receive detailed probability analysis including:

- **Win Probability**: Your chances of having the best hand
- **Tie Probability**: Likelihood of splitting the pot
- **Lose Probability**: Chances of being beaten
- **Expected Best Hand**: Most frequent hand ranking you'll achieve

The calculator uses a Monte Carlo simulation approach, running 50,000 iterations to provide accurate statistical analysis. The algorithm evaluates all possible poker hand rankings from High Card to Royal Flush, accounting for complex scenarios like community card dependencies and multi-player dynamics.

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Basic Usage
1. **Select Your Hand**: Choose your two hole cards using the rank and suit dropdowns
2. **Community Cards** (Optional): Add any known flop, turn, or river cards
3. **Player Count**: Set the number of players in the game (2-10)
4. **Calculate**: Click "Calculate Odds" to run the simulation

### Features
- **Real-time Validation**: Prevents duplicate card selection with visual feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows calculation status during processing
- **Clean Interface**: Intuitive card selection with poker-themed styling

### Example Scenarios
- **Pre-flop Analysis**: Input only your hole cards to get baseline odds
- **Post-flop Strategy**: Add flop cards to refine your decision making
- **Multi-player Dynamics**: Adjust player count to see how it affects your odds
