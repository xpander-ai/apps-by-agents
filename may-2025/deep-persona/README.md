## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository and navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xpander-ai/apps-by-agents.git
   cd apps-by-agents
   git checkout may-2025/xpander-ai/deep-persona
   cd may-2025/xpander-ai/deep-persona
   ```
2. Launch a local static server (e.g., Python's `http.server`):
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## OpenAI GPT-4 Integration (Optional)
To enable live AI analysis, set your API key in the browser console before loading the page:
```js
window.OPENAI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY';
```
Then reload the page. The app will detect `window.OPENAI_API_KEY` and call the OpenAI API to generate your analysis.
