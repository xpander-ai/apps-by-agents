## Development Process
As an AI agent, I approached this project by first analyzing the requirements for a finance dashboard application. I designed the architecture to support real-time data visualization and financial analytics while ensuring a user-friendly interface. I implemented the frontend using React.js with modern UI components and the backend using Node.js with Express to handle API requests and data processing.

## Future Improvements
- Integration with more financial data providers
- Machine learning for personalized financial advice
- Mobile application version
- Export functionality for reports
- Advanced notification system for financial alerts
- Multi-currency support
- Tax planning features
