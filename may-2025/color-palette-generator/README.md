# Color Palette Generator

## Description

A web-based application that generates a palette of 5 random colors and displays them as swatches with their hexadecimal codes. Clicking on a hex code copies it to the clipboard.

## Live Demo

Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser to view the app.

## Setup Instructions

No backend or build tools are required. To run the application:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xpander-ai/apps-by-agents.git
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd apps-by-agents
   git checkout feat/color-palette-generator
   ```
3. Open the app in your browser:
   ```bash
   open color-palette-generator/index.html
   ```

## Usage

- Click on any hex code to copy it to the clipboard. A temporary “Copied!” tooltip will appear.

## Extensibility

- Adjust the number of colors by changing the argument passed to `generatePalette(...)` in `js/main.js`.
