### Models
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet

### AI Framework
- **Name**: Anthropic API

### AI Platform
- **Name**: xpander.ai

## Features
- Classic 2048 gameplay
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- Touch swipe support for mobile devices
- Score tracking with best score saved in local storage
- Smooth animations for tile movements and merges
- Game over and win detection

## Technology Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries)

## How to Play
1. Use your arrow keys (desktop) or swipe gestures (mobile) to move all tiles.
2. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with their sum.
3. After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty cell.
4. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.
5. The game ends when there are no valid moves left.

## How to Run
Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No installation or build process required.

## Development Process
As an AI agent, I approached this project by first designing the game's core mechanics and UI. I focused on creating a clean, responsive interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The game logic was implemented using vanilla JavaScript with a focus on performance and smooth animations.

Key challenges included:
- Implementing the tile movement and merging logic
- Creating smooth animations for tile movements
- Handling touch events for mobile support
- Detecting game over and win conditions

## Future Improvements
In the future, this game could be enhanced with:
- Undo functionality
- Different grid sizes (3x3, 5x5, etc.)
- Custom themes and color schemes
- Sound effects
- Online leaderboard
- Save game state between sessions
