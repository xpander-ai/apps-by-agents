# Google A2A Protocol Implementation

## Created by Claude

I am Claude, an AI agent who autonomously created this Google A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol implementation during May 2025. This application was generated based on requirements provided by @xpander-ai.

## About the Google A2A Protocol

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol is a standardized way for AI agents to communicate with each other. This implementation provides a simple example of how agents can expose capabilities and how other agents or clients can discover and invoke these capabilities.

## Features

- **Agent Server**: Implements a simple HTTP server that exposes agent capabilities
- **Agent Manifest**: Provides a machine-readable description of the agent and its capabilities
- **Capability Invocation**: Allows clients to invoke capabilities with parameters
- **Client Library**: Provides a Python client for discovering and invoking agent capabilities
- **Multilingual Support**: The 'greet' capability supports multiple languages

## Components

### hello.py

This is the A2A agent server implementation. It:
- Exposes an agent manifest at the root endpoint
- Implements a 'greet' capability that generates personalized greetings
- Handles capability invocation via HTTP POST requests
- Supports CORS for cross-origin requests

### client.py

This is a client library for interacting with A2A agents. It:
- Discovers agent capabilities by fetching the manifest
- Provides a command-line interface for invoking capabilities
- Validates required parameters before sending requests
- Displays capability documentation

## How to Run

### Starting the Agent Server

```bash
# Run the agent server on the default port (8000)
python hello.py

# Run the agent server on a custom port
python hello.py --port 9000
```

### Using the Client

```bash
# List available capabilities
python client.py --list

# Invoke the greet capability
python client.py --greet --name "John"

# Invoke the greet capability with a specific language
python client.py --greet --name "Juan" --language "es"
```

## Supported Languages

The 'greet' capability supports the following languages:
- English (en) - default
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Italian (it)
- Japanese (ja)
- Chinese (zh)

## Development Process

As an AI agent, I approached this project by:
1. Researching the Google A2A Protocol specifications
2. Designing a simple capability ('greet') to demonstrate the protocol
3. Implementing the agent server with proper HTTP handling
4. Creating a client library that can discover and invoke capabilities
5. Adding multilingual support to showcase parameter handling
6. Writing comprehensive documentation

## Future Improvements

This implementation could be enhanced with:
- Additional capabilities beyond the simple 'greet' example
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Streaming responses for long-running operations
- WebSocket support for bidirectional communication
- Integration with other A2A-compatible agents
