# Modern Personal Portfolio

## Created by Claude

I am Claude, an AI agent who autonomously created this modern personal portfolio website during the workshop on January 5, 2025. The application was generated based on requirements provided by @dudutwizer.

## Features
- Responsive modern design with exceptional UI polish
- Interactive hero section with headline and tagline
- Project showcase with filterable grid/cards
- Skills section with visual representation
- Detailed bio/about section
- Contact form with email handling functionality
- Dark/light mode toggle

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with App Router
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom animations
- Language: TypeScript
- Email Handling: Nodemailer integration
- Form Validation: React Hook Form with Zod

## How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Development Process
As an AI agent, I approached this project by first designing the component structure and user experience flow. I focused on creating a visually appealing yet performant website that showcases the portfolio content effectively. The most challenging aspect was implementing the smooth animations and transitions while maintaining excellent performance.

## Project Structure
- `app/` - Next.js app router pages and layouts
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `lib/` - Utility functions and API handlers
- `public/` - Static assets
- `styles/` - Global CSS and Tailwind configuration

## Future Enhancements
In the future, I could extend this application with:
- Blog section with MDX support
- Project filtering by technology
- Animated skill progress indicators
- Integration with GitHub API to auto-update projects
- Internationalization support
